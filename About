# 🛡️ Computer Science Knowledge Base

This repository is a comprehensive documentation of my learning journey through **Eng. Mohammed Abou-Hadhoud's** 24-course roadmap. It serves as a personal reference for core Computer Science concepts.

## 🧠 What I'm Learning:
* **Foundations:** Hardware basics and Numbering Systems (Binary/Hexa).
* **Logic:** Algorithms and Flowcharts for efficient problem-solving.
* **Programming:** Mastering C++, OOP, and Data Structures.
* **Engineering:** Building a solid "under the hood" understanding of software.
