# 01- Programming Foundations (Level 1) 🧱

## 🌟 The Beginning of the Journey
I have officially started my deep dive into the world of Computer Science and Programming. My path is guided by the comprehensive roadmap provided by **Eng. Mohammed Abou-Hadhoud**, which is known for its depth and focus on building a "true engineer" rather than just a coder.

In this first stage, the focus is not on writing code yet, but on understanding the **DNA of the computer**—how it thinks, how it stores data, and how it executes instructions at the hardware level.

## 🧠 Core Concepts & Knowledge
In this course, I am exploring several critical topics that form the foundation of any professional software engineer:

* **Numbering Systems:** Mastering the transition between Decimal, Binary, and Hexadecimal systems. This is crucial for understanding memory and low-level data processing.
* **Data Representation:** Learning how integers, characters (ASCII/Unicode), and images are represented in 0s and 1s.
* **Computer Architecture:** Understanding the vital roles of the CPU (The Brain), RAM (Short-term Memory), and Storage (Long-term Memory).
* **Problem Solving Logic:** How to break down complex problems into small, logical steps before writing any line of code.

## ✅ Completed Milestones
I will keep this list updated as I progress through the course:

- [x] Understanding the difference between Hardware and Software.
- [x] Mastering Binary to Decimal conversion and vice versa.
- [x] Mastering Hexadecimal and its relation to Binary shortcuts.
- [x] Deep understanding of Bits, Bytes, and Memory Units (KB, MB, GB, TB).
- [ ] Finalizing the theoretical foundations of Computer Science.
