# 01- Programming Foundations - Comprehensive Summary 🧱

I have successfully mastered the "Under the Hood" mechanics of computers. This folder serves as a knowledge base for everything related to computer logic and hardware interaction.

## 🧠 Technical Knowledge Acquired:

### 1. Numbering Systems & Conversions
* **Binary (Base 2):** The fundamental language of machines (0s and 1s).
* **Octal (Base 8):** Understanding its role as an intermediate system in computing.
* **Hexadecimal (Base 16):** Mastered its use as a shorthand for memory addresses and binary data.
* **Conversions:** Confidently converting numbers manually between Decimal, Binary, Octal, and Hexadecimal.

### 2. Bits, Bytes, and Data Storage
* **Bit vs. Byte:** Understanding that 8 bits make 1 Byte (the basic building block of data).
* **Data Sizes:** Deep knowledge of measurements (KB, MB, GB, TB, PB) and how they relate to RAM and Storage capacity.
* **Data Representation:** How computers encode text (ASCII/Unicode), images, and colors using bits.

### 3. Programming Languages & Levels
* **Low-Level Languages:** Understanding Assembly and Machine Code (closest to hardware).
* **High-Level Languages:** Understanding languages like C++, Python, and Java (closer to human logic).
* **Compilers & Interpreters:** How human-readable code is translated into machine instructions.

### 4. Computer Architecture (Hardware)
* **CPU (The Brain):** Mastered the Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle.
* **Memory Hierarchy:** The difference between volatile RAM and non-volatile Storage (HDD/SSD).
